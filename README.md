[Battle Ship](https://battle-ship.vercel.app/)


## How it works

1 player - play against the machine. After the player chooses the square, the player PC chooses a square randomly.
2 players - after player 1 chooses a square to attack, player 2 chooses your for attack.
The winner is the player who reaches 150 points, meaning to sink all the enemy ships.
